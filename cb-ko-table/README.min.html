binding, you can custom the editor by the two ways:<br> 1. create each field editor on the tr of header section of the table<br> 2. create each field editor on the tr of the tboday of the table<br> for example:<br> <br> Explain:<br> you can add addition attributes on both td or th<br> The additional attributes can be:<br> cellTemplate: it can be plain text (means display the property of data item as string), a string which starts with "BIND: "(means the cell display as an td with the data-bind)<br> or a string with "HTML: " (the cell is represent by the html), see function tableCreater.createCellTemplate<br> notEdit notAdd notEdit="READONLY" or notAdd="READONLY":<br> //notAdd="notAdd" means is not visible for add, and ofcourse is readonly<br> //notAdd="READONLY" means is shown on add, but is readonly<br> //notEdit="notEdit" means is not visible for change, and ofcourse is readonly<br> //notEdit="READONLY" means is shown on change, but is readonly<br> see function tableCreater.isColEditableShown and tableCreater.isColReadOnly<br> editorTemplate: if provide, then use it as the editor when add or change a data item, otherwise use cellTemplate as the editor, the value of it is used in the same way as cellTemplate<br> editorLabel: if proviedd, use it as the label before the editor, otherwise use the col header<br> dataItemProperty: a plain text which is the name of the property of the data item. it is only used in inline model, in inline, when user change a cell, the bound item property will be changed also<br> becasue of the bound, but for the situation that the dataItemVerify is not pass, we need to revert user changes, so before user change, we copied the data item<br> and when dataItemVerify fail, we copy the property (specified by dataItemProperty) of the copied data item back to the data item. <br> if this is not provied, the code will copy every properties of the copied data item to the data item<br> editorFinishEvent: if not provided, then blur will be used, that is to say, when the editor lost focus, the cell will finish the edit, it can be any event name, for example: click and so on<br> editorFinish: if provide, the every time, the editor is created, this code will be used to register the event, used can write code to check if should end cell edit,<br> for example, <br> if($currentCell.index() == 5){<br> $editor.blur(function(){<br> $endEdit();<br> })<br> };<br> order-field: indicate when user click on this header column, which field name should be used to order, when user click on the header, a new item {field: order-field value, ase: true or false}<br> will be added to the table binding orders array<br> notOrder: normally, if the column provide order-field or dataItemProperty, then it will be able ordered by default, in case user provide dataItemProperty and not want it order able, then add notOrder="notOrder" to disable order function for this column<br> if notOrder="notOrder" is added to table, then the whole order function will be disabled<br> for the td, it can have children of templates, for example:<br> <br> there are two kinds of nodes can be defined in templates<br> editor: this is the html definition of the editor when user try to edit (add or change) this cell, if not provided, then editorTemplate will be used<br> cell: this is the html definition of cell when the table is
